# Cursor Rules for Toggle Excluded Files Extension

## Project Context
This is a VS Code extension that toggles the visibility of excluded files in the file explorer. It's built with TypeScript and uses modern development practices.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Follow the existing architectural patterns (Container, Controllers, etc.)
- Maintain the existing logging and error handling patterns
- Use the established decorator patterns for commands
- Keep the clean separation of concerns between controllers

## Key Files to Understand
- `src/extension.ts` - Main entry point
- `src/container.ts` - Dependency injection container
- `src/excludeController.ts` - Core functionality for toggling file exclusions
- `src/commands.ts` - Command registration and handling
- `src/statusBarController.ts` - Status bar integration

## Development Notes
- The extension supports both Node.js and browser environments
- Uses webpack for bundling with esbuild for fast compilation
- Has sophisticated configuration management with type-safe paths
- Implements proper VS Code extension lifecycle management

## When Making Changes
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing VS Code API usage
- Follow the established error handling patterns with proper logging
- Update types in constants.ts if adding new configuration options
- Consider both desktop and web platform compatibility
